A keylogger Proof of Concept I wrote in Java and JRuby years ago as a
challenge by a college friend who claimed it was impossible.

The "keylogger" feature *should* work provided you can run it on a Windows 7 or
previous version of windows with a JRE installed. It might require a bit of
fiddling with the code though.

This software is likely not working on recent version of Windows.
